# Enumerable Methods
In this project, I have created some of the Ruby's Enumerables form scratch. This is a project proposed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks#project-2-enumerable-methods) and is part of the [Microverse curriculum](https://www.microverse.org/#world-class-curriculum).
